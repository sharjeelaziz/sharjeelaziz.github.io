##Tetrahedrally Truncated Dodecahedron Clock
![Tetrahedrally Truncated Dodecahedron](/images/front-view.jpg)

I am learning to draw in SketchUp these days and made myself a nice clock in the process. The clock displays local/UTC time and a time-based one-time password for a selected 2-Step verification account.  The clock consists of a 3D printed case designed in SketchUp and printed by [ShapeWays](http://shpws.me/Im4Y) in [White Strong & Flexible](https://www.shapeways.com/materials/strong-and-flexible-plastic?li=nav) material, a Raspberry Pi, LED seven segment/dot matrix displays and some chalkboard paint. The python code uses the excellent MAX7219 driver by Richard Hull https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219 and https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass by Tom Jaskowski.
