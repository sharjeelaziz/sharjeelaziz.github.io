## Building an APRS iGate and ADS-B plane tracker using Raspberry Pi and RTL SDR dongles

I have always been interested in SDR but never got a chance to really try it out. Luckily I was able to find a lot of resources on the Internet to get me started. A big thank you to all the open source contributors out there as I was able to build an APRS RX-only iGate and an ADS-B plane tracker very quickly. 

Here are the items you would need:

1. RaspberryPi
2. 2 x RTL SDR dongles
3. USB powered hub
4. 4GB SD card
5. Wifi dongle (optional)

I started with a newly prepared SD card. You can download RASPBIAN (Debian Wheezy) OS image from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ and then follow the instructions at http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md to write the image to the SD card.

### Prepare the Raspberry Pi
Login to the raspberry pi and make sure that you have Internet connectivity.

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo raspi-config

A setup screen would be displayed when you run rasps-config. Using the setup screen expand the file system and configure your  time zone.

It seems that the newest kernel includes a DVB driver for the dongle as a TV receiver. We do not require this for our purposed so we will create a config file to blacklist it. 

	cd /etc/modprobe.d
	sudo nano blacklist-rtl.conf

Add the following lines to the new file:

	blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
	blacklist rtl2832
	blacklist rtl2830

### Install the dependencies

	sudo apt-get install git git-core cmake build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev
	sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libpulse-dev libx11-dev patch pulseaudio
	sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf automake libfftw3-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-pkg-resources pkg-config

### Install RTL SDR driver

	cd ~
	git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
	cd rtl-sdr
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../ -DDETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER=ON -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo ldconfig

At this point, you should be able to run the rtl_test command. The command would find the devices, display supported gain values, and do some sampling. It should report everything is okay.

### Install multimonNG decoder

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimonNG.git
	cd multimonNG
	mkdir build
	cd build
	qmake ../multimon-ng.pro
	make
	sudo make install

### Install the kalibrate tool

Kalibrate, or kal, scans for GSM base stations in a given frequency band and uses GSM base stations to calculate the local oscillator frequency offset of the rtl-sdr devices.

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/asdil12/kalibrate-rtl.git
	cd kalibrate-rtl
	git checkout arm_memory
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

With kal it is a two step process. We find a strong channel first.

	kal -s GSM900

Once we have the strong channel number we can find the ppm.

	kal -c 34 -v

I was not able to use kal reliably to find the ppm offset in my area and used SDR# to manually find the ppm value. 

### Install APRS iGate software

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/asdil12/pymultimonaprs.git
	cd pymultimonaprs
	sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python2
	sudo python2 setup.py install

Configure the startup script

	sudo cp pymultimonaprs.init /etc/init.d/pymultimonaprs
	sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/pymultimonaprs
	sudo update-rc.d pymultimonaprs defaults

### Generate APRS-IS password

	cd ~/pymultimonaprs
	./keygen.py CALLSIGN
	Key for CALLSIGN: 12345

Update the pymultimonaprs configuration file with your callsign, passcode, gateway, freq, ppm, gain, lat, lng, and device index. Device index is important when multiple RTL SDR dongles are plugged in. Enter the index number of the dongle you would like to use with pymultimonaprs. You should be able to find the device index by using the rtl_test command.

	sudo nano /etc/pymultimonaprs.json


### Test and decode APRS packets

	rtl_fm -d 0 -f 144390000 -s 22050 -p -103 -g 42.0 - | multimon-ng -a AFSK1200 -A -t raw -

I was not able to pick up any stations in my apartment on the ground floor. However, I was able to decode packets from my APRS device.

### Start pymultimonaprs

	sudo /etc/init.d/pymultimonaprs start

### Install dump1090 to decode ADS-B transmissions from aircraft
Dump1090 is a simple Mode S decoder for RTLSDR devices

	cd ~
	git clone git://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090.git
	cd dump1090
	make

### Start dump1090

	cd ~
	cd dump1090
	./dump1090 --net --aggressive --ppm 43 --device-index 1
